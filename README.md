## 🧠 Overview

This simple yet elegant web app was created to display the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DIU)** final exam schedule for **Batch 60**.
It was built during the hectic exam preparation period when the routine sheet was published as a static notice — making it difficult for students to check details quickly.

The app provides a **modern, responsive interface** where users can:

* View the full exam routine in a clean table format.
* Click on any date or exam row to view detailed room and column allocations.
* Access all information in one page without needing to scroll through PDFs or notices.

* 🖱️ **Click any exam row** to view detailed room and column information
* 💡 Clean **modal pop-up design** for viewing details
* 🌗 Simple dark-themed, visually appealing layout
* ⚡ Lightweight and fast — runs completely in the browser
* 📱 Fully responsive across desktop and mobile
